# Keep talking, and Bob might not die

Meet Sleigh. Bob Sleigh. Special agent on your majesty's secret service. Getting back from a special mission, he got lost in snowy mountains. He has to keep ploughing through the snow and thin ice to survive in this unfriendly landscape. As an obedient employee, Bob strictly follows your voice. Therefore he walks only if you talk to him. Sounds simple? Not really!
